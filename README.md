Health Monitering System 
    Adults or old aged people generally are to be monitored for their health issues , even sometimes patients and infants are to be checked for their health conditions.AI has been revolutionising our future.Building a product which can be used to monitor health conditions is our main aim.Senors are used to collect the data and give us the different conditions of the patient like pulse rate, environmental conditions , temperature ,diabetes risk etc and these are linked with the model built to predict the occurances or change in the risk factor of a disease or the health condition in the person.These data can be further examined by the professional doctors and treated accordingly.So our model basically alarms if there is any sudden changes in the health conditions of the person.
